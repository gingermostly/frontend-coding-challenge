# Front-end Coding Challenge

## Getting started
* To install dependencies:
`Yarn install`

* To run webpack dev server:
`Yarn start`

* Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in browser to view page

## Technologies used
* React
* Used both CSS Grid and flex instead of table to make layout responsive and avoid styling issues that are unique to tables

## Features wish list (things I would add and do if I had more time!)

* Add sticky button that appears on scroll to return user to top of page
* Refactor code so that number of issues is pulled from the GitHub issues api and includes all issues instead of just current.
* Refactoring to improve performance and prevent waiting for results to load when scrolling
* Install Jest for more extensive testing of functionality
* Additional features like allowing user to sort results or search descriptions, maybe add the ability to enter a date so user can choose the specific number of past days to display instead of just defaulting to past 30 days

## GitHub API

* Updated link to GitHub API documentation: [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/search).
